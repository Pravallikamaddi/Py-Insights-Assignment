# 📌 Browsing History Analysis - Placement Round 1

This project was part of the first round of a placement process, where I analyzed browsing history data using Python (Jupyter Notebook) and Power BI. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and meaningful insights.

## 📊 Key Features

✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Handling Missing Values, Duplicates, Data Type Conversion)✅ Python-Based Visualizations (Matplotlib & Seaborn)✅ Power BI Dashboard for Interactive Analysis✅ Meaningful Insights & Final Report

 ## 📂 Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

Power BI

Jupyter Notebook

## 📸 Sample Visualizations

🔹 Top 10 Most Visited Websites



🔹 Browsing Activity by Hour



🔹 Browsing Activity by Day of the Week



📖 Insights & Takeaways

🔹 Peak browsing hours occur between 6 PM and 10 PM → Suggests prime time for engagement.🔹 Weekends have the highest activity → Best time for targeted content strategies.🔹 Most visits come from link clicks → Internal linking & referrals play a key role in user flow.

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

🔹 Jupyter Notebook (Python Analysis)

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Browsing-History-Analysis.git

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Run all cells to generate visualizations.

🔹 Power BI Dashboard

Open Power BI Desktop.

Load the dataset (dataset.csv).

Import the Power BI file (browsing_analysis.pbit).
